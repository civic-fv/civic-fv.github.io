Bio as of 12/10/2020:

Ganesh L. Gopalakrishnan (Senior Member of IEEE and ACM Distinguished
Scientist) earned his B.Sc.(EE) degree from NIT Calicut in 1978,
M.Tech (EE) from IIT Kanpur in 1980, and PhD in Computer Science from
Stony Brook University in 1986, when he joined the University of Utah.

His research interests are in correctness methods for shared memory
and message passing programming, and education methods in parallel and
concurrent programming, as well as in computer science foundations,
with an emphasis on formal methods.

His currently active projects are: Verification Methods and Tool
Frameworks for parallel and concurrent systems (NSF), Floating-point
Precision Tuning Methods (NSF), Methods to detect Compiler-Induced
Numerical Variability in scientific codes (Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory), Methods to enhance System Resilience (DOE), Scalable
OpenMP Data Race Checking methods, and Symbolic Data Race Checking
Methods for GPUs.  His research grants and contracts are from NSF,
DOE, and lab subcontracts.

His external engagements include Visiting Assistant Professorship at
the University of Calgary (1988-89) and sabbatical visits at Stanford
University (1995-96), Intel (2002-03), and sabbatical projects with
Microsoft on developing parallel computing curriculum (2009-10), and
work on textbooks using Jupyter notebooks in undergraduate Discrete
Math and Automata Theory classes (2016-17).

He has published two textbooks: (1) Computation Engineering: Applied
Automata Theory and Logic, Springer, 2006. (2) Automata and
Computability: A Programmer's Perspective, CRC Press, 2019. He has
published over 180 refereed papers, and has graduated 22 PhD students,
and mentored 44 Undergraduate Researchers to date.

He is serving as the Director of the Center for Parallel Computing at
Utah ("CPU").  He was awarded one of the six "Beacons of Excellence"
Awards for 2012 by the University of Utah for his work on mentoring
undergraduates.

His PhD students have received these honors: 2020 Best Student Paper
in Supercomputing 2020 (PhD student Arnab Das); 2020 Test of Time
Honorable Mention in Foundations of Software Engineering 2020 (PhD
student Guodong Li for his paper in 2010); 2020 Nvidia Graduate
Fellowship (PhD student Vinu Joseph); and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory Director's 2020 Excellence in Publication (Student Category
Winner, Ph.D. Student: Michael Bentley).
