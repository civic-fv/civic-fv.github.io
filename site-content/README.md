 About
========
This is the content management directory of the ${ProjName} project.
It is built on the Jekyll static website building system.
Please go and review the main [`README.md`](/README.md) 
 for information on how to configure your setup to use this system.

This system is configured to work for most hosting service including GitHub Pages, 
 with the cavitate that it must be built manually before pushing to the host service.
This is due to use of external scripts and uncommon Jekyll plugins.

This Site works by taking the information located in the `site-content` directory 
 and combining it with the nitty gritty details in the [`site-src`](../site-src) directory
 to build a semi-static website.

Information you need to put in to build the site goes in `pubs.bib` 
  and the files in the `data` directory.
Blog posts go in the posts directory, in either `_post` or `_draft` for their namesakes.
More information about these topics are below in their respective sections. 


 BibTeX Files    
================

 The primary use for the BibTeX files is for listing on the publication's "tab"/page information about this project's various publications.

There are two uses for BibTeX files:
 1. The primary use for the BibTeX files is for listing on the publication's "tab"/page
     information about this project's various publications.
    - These must be listed in the [`/site-content/pubs.bib`](./pubs.bib) file.
 2. The secondary use for BibTeX files, 
     is to be able to [add citations](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#citations)
     with the `jekyll-scholar` plugin \[[doc](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar)\],
     in blog posts, 
     then [produce a Bibliography](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar#bibliographies) 
     at the end of said blog post.\
    _(see the [citations](#citations) sub-section 
     of the [Blog Post](#blog-post) section of this document for more info.)_
    - These can be any `.bib` file anywhere in the [`/site-content/`](./) directory,
       or any sub-directory of [`/site-content/`](./),
       but the main one will be [`/site-content/references.bib`](./refrences.bib).
    - In the end no matter where you put them all BibTeX entries will be combined 
       into one `.bib` file (even those in [`/site-content/pubs.bib`](./pubs.bib)),
       and therefore accessible anywhere on the site.
      - Therefore all BibTeX key's must be unique across all files.
 <!-- 2. Adding entries for the various information tabs of the website:
    - The people involved in the project, 
       on the people tab of the website.
    - The software created by this project, 
       on the software tab of the website.
    - The supplementary Educational materials, events & recordings that this project produces,
       or thinks would be useful for people interested in the project to know about, 
       on the Education/Talks tab of the website. -->

### BibTeX File Requirements
- Have the BibTeX File Extension (`.bib`)
  - Name of the file is irrelevant, 
     but we recommend using the existing files in [`/site-content/`](./) directory:
    - [`pubs.bib`](./pubs.bib) specifically and ONLY for BibTeX entries for publications
       made by this project.
    - [`references.bib`](./references.bib) for BibTeX entries that you might want to 
       [cite](#citations) in a "[blog post](#blog-post)" 
       or anywhere else on the site.
- Be syntactically valid BibTeX. \[[doc](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/)\]
  - All entries across all files must have unique "names"/IDs.
    - Entry names are always the first item in an entry, have no spaces, 
       are case insensitive, & do not have an associated key. \
       _i.e._
      ```bib
      @article{this-is-the-id, ...}
      ``` 
  - _**Note:** BibTeX is case insensitive for all key/field IDs,_
    _but will preserve letter case in their associated values._
- We, by convention, 
   request that you make any additional BibTeX files in your own sub-directory 
   of the [`/site-content/posts`](./posts) directory.
  This is to avoid any unessisary merge conflicts 
   that may arise from people trying to update the site at the same time. 


## Publication Entries
Publication entries **MUST** go in [`/site-content/pubs.bib`](./pubs.bib), 
 and they should follow the following conventions:
- Have an entry type **not** of `@COMMENT`, preamble `@PREAMBLE` (if you want it to work), 
   or any unofficial entry type for the citation standard the site is using. <br/>
   &emsp; _(Default: chicago-annotated-bibliography)_
- Have all of the required fields of the citation format the site is using. <br/>
   &emsp; _(Default: chicago-annotated-bibliography)_
  - Will ignore any fields that the citation format does not make use of.
  - The site has special purposes for the following fields that will be used 
     for rendering the info-box, even if the citation format does not support them:
    |      Field | Description   |  _Â¿Required?_ |
    |-----------:|---------------|:-------------:|
    | **`abstract`** | The publication's abstract or your own summary.<br/> This will be a single paragraph description that will be visible in the drop down info box.<br/> (_i.e._ the formatter surround it in `<p>` tags and strip the html out.) | _recommended_ |
    | **`note`** | A Note about the status of the publication, like if it is still under revision or if it has been retracted.<br/> This will be displayed at the top of the drop down info box, stylized to draw attention to it.      |       NO      |
    | **`year`** | Even if you have a `date` field, you will need this so that the webpage can sort the publication into a category on the website.     | YES |
> #### Example
> In [`/site-content/pubs.bib`](./pubs.bib):
> ```bib
> @article{taco-failamp,
>   author = {Ian Briggs and Arnab Das and Vishal Sharma and Mark Baranowski and
>   Sriram Krishnamoorthy and
>   Zvonimir Rakamaric and Ganesh Gopalakrishnan},
>   title = {FailAmp: Relativization Transformation
>            for Soft Error Detection in Structured Address
>            Generation},
>   journal = {ACM TACO},
>   note = {Under revision},
>   year = {2019},
>   abstract = {IDK I have not read it and the bib did not include a proper abstract, 
>               but the site does support abstracts <b>& even limited html !!</b> <br/>
>               &emps; <i>NOTE: supports any HTML tags that can go in a `p` tag (&lt;p&gt;)</i>
>              }
> }
> ```

## Reference Entries
These will be normal BibTeX entries found in any `.bib` file in the `/site-content` directory, 
 or any subdirectory therein.
This includes the [`/site-content/pubs.bib`](./pubs.bib) file.
You can use them to cite things & then generate bibliographies in blog posts 
 & other jekyll markdown pages, across the site
 _(see the [Citations](#citations) section for mote info)_.

There are no major requirements or special considerations for these beyond what is stated in 
 the [BibTeX File Requirements](#bibtex-file-requirements) section.


  YAML Data Files
===================
In order to maintain data structures to use for generating content we use (`.yml`) files.
That hold data formatted in the Yet Another Markup language (YMAL) 
 \[[syntax-spec](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)\] \[[tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm)\].
_Which is a proper superset of JSON, so if you get confused 
 you can just start typing JSON after any `<key>:` and it should work just fine._

These data files are use dto dynamically generate content for the site.
Currently there are three catagories of such info, and later in this file we will go over them in greater detail.
 1. [`/site-content/data/education.yml`](./data/education.yml): 
     this is for educational resources 
     that you would like to have show up on the education "tab"/page.
    Be they textbooks, seminars, activities, _etc._
    The main idea is that they help to educate visitors to the site about the topics
     this project works on.
    - please note this will not allow you to cite them, 
       for that you will also need to add an entry to a BibTeX file as described
       in the [BibTeX Files](#bibtex-files) section(s).
 2. [`/site-content/data/people.yml`](./data/people.yml): 
     this is for YOU.
    Meaning, this is where you should put in data about you for it to show up on the 
     people "tab"/page, which serves as the credits for the project.
    Here you will put in all of the requisite information to show up, as well as,
     extra information if you so choose, like GitHub and social links, _etc._
 3. [`/site-content/data/software.yml`](./data/software.yml):
      this is for any software that the project puts out.
    Will be rendered out on the Software "tab"/page.

In addition you can add any other 
 YAML (`.yml`/`.yaml`), JSON (`.json`), CSV (`.csv`), or TSV (`.tsv`) files
 you would like, to the [`/site-content/data/`](./data/) directory.
Then you can have access to the data in them with Jekyll's liquid comments,
 in any blog post or other page you create for the site
 _(see the [jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more info on using 
 [data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/), 
 & [liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/))_.

  Blog Posts
==============

## Setup
Blog posts are in files with the name format `YYY-MM-DD-Your-Title.md`.
We request to avoid confusion and merge conflicts, that you only modify files in your own sub-directory of [`/site-content/`](./).

The file must start with a `yaml` header enclosed in `---`, of the following format.

```yml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Fancy Title"
author: "Who Wrote It"
---
```

The rest is mostly standard markdown. One blog post per file.

We recommend using uploading images and other multimedia to external sites like [imgur](https://imgur.com) then linking with static URL's from that hosting service.
If you know how to use Jekyll's liquid comments to build proper URLs to local resources, you can store images in the `/site-src/images` directory.
But as mentioned the external linking method would be best in most cases for simplicity, and ensuring efficient builds & data transfer and storage restrictions on GitHub.

> #### Advanced
> The site uses [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build static websites from dynamic data.\
> Therefore, if you know how to use 
>  [jekyll's liquid template syntax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/)
>  you can make more dynamic webpages.\
> This also means that despite this being markdown, unlike most places you can use markdown,
>  you can insert custom javascript, so long as it is client side only.\
> Finally this means that you can use jekyll plugins to improve your content, 
>  though unless you know how to use jekyll and have the permissions of the site maintainer,
>  you should only use the plugins currently installed on the site.
> Which if you know jekyll you should be able to figure out what ones are installed.
